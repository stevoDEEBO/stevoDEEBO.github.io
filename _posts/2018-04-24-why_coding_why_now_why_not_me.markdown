Living in a world surrounded by technology that is only becoming more complex and integrated into every day life...why not?

Why start now? Living in a house with 2 toddlers and a 3rd baby on the way while looking for work and navigating the nonstop culture of New York City, this does not seem like the most opportune timing for becoming a student and adding more financial pressure to the household. Is it the exciting world of web and app development? Is the the promise of a great career on the horizon? Is it the desire to escape a world full of gray polyester walls and repetitive every day operations? Or maybe it's all of these?

I'm at a crossroads...one where it's time to figure out a direction for my life. One way could lead up the road in healthcare administrative support and operations that could one day lead to a promising career in healthcare administration or project management (with a bit more schooling) and another could lead...well, anywhere.

I have always been technical in my skillset and mindset, but after graduating with an engineering degree, I  never wandered down that path because my desire to help people steered me another way. Now that I have explored the support world, I am finally ready to explore how to fully incorporate my tech skills into a world where I can help others. 

I have a cousin who recently left college to complete a coding bootcamp. He knows he made the right decision and has been doing really well professionally since. Talking to him and seeing the results of many other students' experiences online has really inspired me to explore this path to anywhere, because after all, why not me?
