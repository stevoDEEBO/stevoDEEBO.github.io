Cascading Style Sheets......seem pretty simple at first...Clearly Simple Stylistics maybe? So far so good, but I have feeling this may become more difficult in the coming weeks. More on that later...

For now, adding style to webpages is...well, pretty essential, no? It's great to have wonderful content that enthralls the reader during the exploration of a website...but what if plain content doesn't pull them in to begin with? That's where CSS comes in...adding various <font size="10">sizes,</font> <font color=#33ddff>colors,</font> <b><u><i>stylings</i></u></b>, spacing, etc and so on and so on. Making a webpage visually attractive is much more effective than relying on awesome content alone. I haven't had a ton of experience with CSS yet, but I can't wait to explore more in future labs & projects to make some stunning sites!

And now nokogiri....is my new headache. Such a powerful Ruby gem for utilizing CSS tags for scraping info from sites. Off to explore this more and report back!
